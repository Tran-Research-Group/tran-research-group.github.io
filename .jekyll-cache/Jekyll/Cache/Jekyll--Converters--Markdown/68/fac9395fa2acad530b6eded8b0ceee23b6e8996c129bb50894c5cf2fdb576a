I"T<p>Our paper “Social sensing: towards social media as a sensor for resilience in power systems and other critical infrastructures” was accepted for publication in Sustainable and Resilient Infrastructure! We demonstrate the value of social media for critical infrastructure (CI) resilience by using social media to model CI behaviors at higher spatiotemporal resolutions than previously shown. We find evidence of statistically significant correlations between Twitter and power system data, and develop models for forecasting future behaviors in the NYISO power system using these data.</p>
